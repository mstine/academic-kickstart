Just to prove that I am writing, just not here, I thought I'd post another collection of links to my latest Agile Zone articles:

* [Yes You Kanban!](http://java.dzone.com/articles/yes-you-kanban)        
* [The Guerilla's Workflow](http://java.dzone.com/articles/guerillas-workflow)
* [Feedback is the Key!](http://java.dzone.com/articles/feedback-key)
* [Going Guerilla: Where to Start](http://java.dzone.com/articles/going-guerilla-where-start)

In the near future you can look forward to a few more episodes of "The Agile Guerilla" series, as well as a brand new series I'll be starting entitled "The Seven Wastes of Software Development."

Got any topics you want to hear more about? Post up in the comments and I'll see about covering them at Agile Zone in the coming weeks!

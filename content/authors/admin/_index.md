Matt Stine is a {{< career_years >}} year veteran of the enterprise IT industry, with seven of those years spent as a consulting solutions architect for multiple Fortune 500 companies, as well as the not-for-profit [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org). He is the author of [Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/migrating-cloud-native-application-architectures.csp) from O'Reilly, and the host of the [Software Architecture Radio](http://www.softwarearchitecturerad.io) podcast.

Matt is a frequent publisher of Atomic Essays and Twitter Threads on software engineering and other topics. You can find most of his current writing at his [Social Blog](https://typeshare.co/g/mstine) on [TypeShare](https://typeshare.co). If you'd like to learn how to become a successful online writer, I'd invite you to sign-up for an upcoming cohort of [Ship 30 for 30](https://enroll.ship30for30.com/a/xubgz).

Matt spends much of his time thinking about lean/agile software development methodologies, DevOps, architectural principles/patterns/practices, and programming paradigms, in an attempt to find the perfect storm of techniques that will allow corporate IT organizations to not only function like startup companies, but also create software that delights users while maintaining a high degree of conceptual integrity. He currently provides technical leadership at one of the world's largest banks.

Matt has spoken at conferences ranging from JavaOne to OSCON to YOW!, was a ten-year member of the [No Fluff Just Stuff](https://nofluffjuststuff.com) tour, and previously served as Technical Editor of [NFJS the Magazine](https://nofluffjuststuff.com/magazine/). Matt is also the founder and past president of the Memphis Java User Group.

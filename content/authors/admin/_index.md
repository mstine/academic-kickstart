Matt spends much of his time thinking about lean/agile software development methodologies, DevOps, architectural principles/patterns/practices, and programming paradigms, in an attempt to find the perfect storm of techniques that will allow corporate IT organizations to not only function like startup companies, but also create software that delights users while maintaining a high degree of conceptual integrity. He is currently Executive Director, Architecture, for [JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) Asset and Wealth Management.

Matt has spoken at conferences ranging from JavaOne to OSCON to YOW!, was a ten-year member of the [No Fluff Just Stuff](https://nofluffjuststuff.com) tour, and previously served as Technical Editor of [NFJS the Magazine](https://nofluffjuststuff.com/magazine/).

My passion is taking a metaphysical approach to software engineering: **what is the nature of the collaborative game that we continuously play, and are there better, more contextually-aware ways to play that game?**

By day I lead a team tasked with taking **a first-principles-centric approach to intentionally enabling programming language usage** at the largest bank in the United States.

By night I write and teach my way through **a masterclass in software engineering and architecture targeting early-career software engineers working in large-scale enterprise technology organizations**.

## What is the primary goal?

To win the game. More seriously: **to get 1% better every day at providing business value through software.**

## Who am I?

I'm a {{< career_years >}}-year veteran of the enterprise software industry. I've played almost every role I can imagine:

- Software Engineer
- Software Architect
- Technical Lead
- Engineering Manager
- Consultant
- Product Manager
- Field CTO
- Developer Advocate
- Conference Speaker
- Author
- Technical Trainer
- Technical Marketer
- Site Reliability Engineer
- Desktop Support Specialist

I've worked at Fortune 500 companies, a tenacious teal cloud startup, and a not-for-profit children's hospital. I've written a book, and I've hosted a podcast. I've learned a lot along the way, including many things I wish I'd known when I first got started. And so now I want to pass those learnings on to you, especially if you've only just begun your career.

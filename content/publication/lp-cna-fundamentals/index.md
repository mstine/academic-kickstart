abstract: "Pattern languages have been a mainstay of modern software development for more than 20 years, and certainly since the release in 1997 of the seminal work, A Pattern Language, by Christopher Alexander. This methodology of programming has long since become the basis for design best practices among developers worldwide and across many programming platforms. In this learning path designed for intermediate- to advanced-level software architects, lead engineers, or software developers, you’ll take a brief look at the fundamentals of cloud native architecture. You’ll examine the three concepts of DevOps, Continuous Delivery, and Cloud Infrastructure. Then you'll learn what ties all three of these together."

**What you’ll learn—and how you can apply it**

* What DevOps is and what are its uses
* What Continuous Delivery is and its usability and testability
* How DevOps, Continuous Delivery, and Cloud Infrastructure are tied together
* How to articulate the high-level narrative of cloud-native architecture and understand why it is important to your business
* How to articulate the paradigm shift involved in cloud-native architectural thinking

**This learning path is for you because…**

* You are an experienced application architect, lead engineer, or senior developer building medium- to large-scale enterprise applications and you need to begin integrating cloud infrastructure into your solutions
* You want to understand how to create systems optimized for DevOps and Continuous Delivery (CD) environments
* You need to begin migrating your existing applications to cloud-native architectures

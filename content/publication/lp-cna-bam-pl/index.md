abstract: "In this learning path, software architecture master Matt Stine describes how pattern languages help people communicate the concepts behind software architecture and then moves into an exploration of the new pattern language he's invented: the Brick and Mortar pattern language. Based on three unifying metaphors–the LEGO® building system, interchangeable parts from the Industrial Revolution, and the repair and regenerate behaviors of cellular organic systems–Stine's new language explains cloud native architecture, the patterns that define it, and why cloud architecture could meet the software industry's desire for a component marketplace, where powerful systems are created from commodity components and standardized mechanisms."

abstract: "Running IT for a bank is not for the faint of heart. The job requires a unique mix of creativity, agility, pragmatism, and plenty of grit. After all, you're tasked with navigating generational changes like cloud computing and distributed systems. How can you capitalize on these seismic shifts and gain market share? By becoming a cloud-native enterprise. Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is a popular tool that can help make this happen. Pivotalâ€™s engineers and architects have worked with seven of the top banks in recent years. Our team has refined best practices for how to best deploy PCF, and how to best develop modern apps. This insight helps customers reduce risk and deliver high-quality software faster. Our learnings are encapsulated in this white paper as reference architectures. These designs help banks deliver software continuously, in a secure and scalable way."

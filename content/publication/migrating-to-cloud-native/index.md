Author Matt Stine also examines the cultural, organizational, and technical changes necessary to migrate traditional monolithic applications and service-oriented architectures to cloud-native architectures. You’ll also find a Migration Cookbook, with recipes for decomposing monolithic applications into microservices, implementing fault-tolerant patterns, and performing automated testing of cloud-native services.

This report discusses application architectures that include:

* **The Twelve-Factor App:** a collection of cloud-native app architecture patterns
* **Microservices:** independently deployable services that do one thing well
* **Self-Service Agile Infrastructure:** platforms for rapid, repeatable, and consistent provisioning of app environments and backing services
* **API-based Collaboration:** published and versioned APIs that allow interaction between services in a cloud-native app architecture
* **Anti-Fragility:** systems that get stronger when subjected to stress
